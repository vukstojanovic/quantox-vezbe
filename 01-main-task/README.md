**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
